<p1>What is soccer?</p1><br>

<p1>Soccer is a sport where two teams of 11 players play against each other
    the purpose is to score more points than the other team. Usually one of 
    the eleven players is known as the goalkeeper. The main job of the person is to not 
    let the ball pass the goal line.</p1><br>

<br><p2>What is Basketball?</p2><br>

<p2>Basketball is a sport that you play using your hands. Is like soccer but you have two
    teams of 5 players each. And the point system is different too. In basket ball. If you score out of the
    box than is 3 point, but if you score inside the box is only 2 points.</p2>
